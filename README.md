# Module 4 - Culmination Lab: Smart Contract Using Truffle and Ganache

## Background
Following the inception of the Ethereum world computer and smart contracts which run on it, many tools for development of smart contracts have come about. A few noteworthy tools address issues such as risk and other costs to deploy and test smart contracts. Prior to beginning this lab, it is assumed that you have completed the installations of Python, Node.js, Truffle, and Ganache. In this lab, we will create a "Hello World" smart contract which will be executed locally on our personal blockchain.
